Welcome! Here is a Concentration project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using ruby.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

In this project, you will build a concentration game, which is played by matching cards. Write methods to populate a board with matching objects behind cards, to reveal a selected card, and to reveal the pair when there is a match. A timer is given to keep track of your progress.

Try it out!
